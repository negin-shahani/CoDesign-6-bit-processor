# CoDesign-6-bit-processor
We plan to implement a processor that includes four commands: LOAD, ADD, SUB and JNZ.
We used VHDL to do this. Also, first we will have a series of assembly codes that we need to pass to an assembler that is specifically designed for our processor and convert the assembly code to binary code. Next, we store these binary codes in memory and the processor executes the operation.
